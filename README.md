#house_room_classifier/house_room_classifier/data
-data_exploration.py: our functions we use when exploring the data are stored here.
-preprocessing.py our functions used for preprocessing are defined and stored here.
#house_room_classifier/house_room_classifier/models
-model_architectures.py: all the models trained and their architectures are defined here.
-room_classifier_model.py: used for building, training and saving all the models trained.
-training_config.py: sets the configuration for hyper-parameters.
#house_room_classifier/house_room_classifier/utils
-visualization_data.py: our custom functions to visualize are stored here and called on the notebook later.
#house_room_classifier/notebooks
-exploration_prepocessing.ipynb: this is the notebook where we explore the data and do preprocessing.
-model_training.ipynb: this is the notebook where we train our models.
-predictions.ipynb: this is the notebook where we show our predictions on the test data and evaluate our final models.
#house_room_classifier/scripts
-has some .py files where we have tested our functions and methods before using them on notebooks.
